# Intro

Glad to be able to apply for your project, I really like it, itâ€™s promising and worth investing my knowledge and efforts in it

- More
    
    We arenode operator with more than 2 years of experience in different ecosystems
    Our skills are considered valuable, I am not a novice, I have met different problems and learned how to solve them
    
    We are not only participate in projects as a node operator, but also invest in them, I donâ€™t spare valuable things for those in whom I have confidence. I really hope that your project in the process of development will become the same
    
    For validators I use powerful servers, which I not only rent but also use my local ones, which increases the decentralization of the network. I monitor the nodes 24 hours a day through different services, which allows them to work non-stop and autonomously.
